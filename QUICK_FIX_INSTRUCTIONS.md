# ðŸš¨ QUICK FIX for ReferenceError: result is not defined

## The Problem
Your server is running old compiled JavaScript code in `dist/index.js` that has a scoping error.

## The Solution
You need to rebuild the application on your server to compile the fixed TypeScript code.

## Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Connect to your server
```bash
ssh santosh@34.14.198.14
```

### 2. Navigate to project directory
```bash
cd /home/santosh/cloudedze
```

### 3. Stop the application
```bash
pm2 stop cloudedze
```

### 4. Copy the fixed files manually

**Option A: Copy from your local machine**
```bash
# From your local machine, run:
scp server/services/oci-inventory.ts santosh@34.14.198.14:/home/santosh/cloudedze/server/services/
scp server/services/python-scripts/oci-inventory.py santosh@34.14.198.14:/home/santosh/cloudedze/server/services/python-scripts/
```

**Option B: Edit the file directly on server**
If copying doesn't work, you can edit the file directly on your server:

```bash
# Edit the TypeScript file
nano server/services/oci-inventory.ts
```

The key fix is to ensure all the new resource processing code is INSIDE the `discoverResources()` method, before the summary calculation.

### 5. Set permissions
```bash
chmod +x server/services/python-scripts/oci-inventory.py
```

### 6. Build the application (CRITICAL!)
```bash
npm run build
```

### 7. Start the application
```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --name cloudedze
```

### 8. Save PM2 configuration
```bash
pm2 save
```

### 9. Check if it's working
```bash
pm2 logs cloudedze
```

## What This Fixes
- âœ… Resolves `ReferenceError: result is not defined`
- âœ… Enables discovery of 15+ OCI resource types
- âœ… Provides comprehensive cloud inventory scanning

## Expected Results
After rebuilding, your OCI inventory should discover:
- Compute Instances, Images, Volume Groups
- VCNs, Subnets, Security Groups, Gateways
- Databases, Load Balancers, Functions
- Monitoring, Identity, and many more resources

**The key is step 6 - `npm run build` - this compiles the fixed TypeScript code!**
